I recently enrolled in ['Financial Markets' by Yale University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/financial-markets-global) - a coursera program, to start exploring Economics. As a Software Engineer this field is very much uncharted territory for me, so if you have a roadmap to exploring Economics from scratch I'd be happy to hear from you.
